# Task 1.2P (Pass Task)

## Overview
The aim of this task is to get you started with onTrack submission system, and get on top of marking and evaluation system that we have set-up for this trimester. By now, we are expecting that you have set-up Microsoft Visual Studio or Code on your computers, and have writen the ‘Hello World’ program.

In this task, we will provide you with series of sub-tasks — with goal that you demonstrate your understanding of loops and other control sequences. You have studied loops in SIT102, we will make use of them in this unit as well, as they are fundamental to any programming paradigm. It is important that you do these tasks, as they will be a good starting point to the world of C# programming that we are using in this unit 

If you are on Mac or Linux — you will have to use Visual Studio Code. 

## Submission Details
You must submit following files to onTrack:
- [x] Submit all C# code files of the classes created, along with any other documentation
- [x] Make sure that your programs implement the required functionality. They must compile and have no runtime errors
- [x] Programs causing compila;on or runtime errors will not be accepted as a solution. You need to test your program thoroughly before submission. Think about potential errors where your program might fail.
