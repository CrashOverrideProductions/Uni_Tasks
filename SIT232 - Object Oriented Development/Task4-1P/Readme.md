# Task 4.1C (Pass Task) - Inheritance

## Overview
These are series of very detailed set of tasks, you will be expected to do in this Pass Task. The objective of this ac=vity is to get you started with the fundamental idea of inheritance in object oriented programming. Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the features and behaviour of another class. The class whose features are inherited is known as a super class (or a base class or a parent class). The class that inherits from the other class is known as a subclass (or a derived class, or a extended class, or a child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods. Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”. That is, when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the exis=ng class. 

## Submission Details
You must submit following files to onTrack:
- [x] Submit all C# code files of the classes created, along with any other documentation
- [x] Make sure that your programs implement the required functionality. They must compile and have no runtime errors
- [x] Programs causing compila;on or runtime errors will not be accepted as a solution. You need to test your program thoroughly before submission. Think about potential errors where your program might fail.
