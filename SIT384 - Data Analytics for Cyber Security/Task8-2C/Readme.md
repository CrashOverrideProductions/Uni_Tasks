# Task 1.1P (Pass Task) -  DGA domain name clustering

## Overview
According to Wikipedia, Domain generation algorithms (DGA) are algorithms seen in various families of malware that are used to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used as rendezvous points with their command and control servers. The large number of potential rendezvous points makes it difficult for law enforcement to effectively shut down botnets, since infected computers will attempt to contact some of these domain names every day to receive updates or commands. Domains generated by dictionary DGA tend to be more difficult to detect due to their similarity to legitimate domains. The following are some sample domains:

V6PNSC80LL.COM JVRRMMKYEJDEYLCQ.COM
B9U5R3RJMPP.COM LKLHJONIUDKKHCWO.COM
YM5R99EX5Q8.COM CADDBSGSCNYDZOH5F.COM
MBSIGLGFQIH2.COM CEUNNFOHGWJYAUA9H.COM
GSJZNQCOHIKO.COM NQZHTFHRMYMTVBQJE.COM
VEG2671WMX88.COM OVLREWGRHHVAJBOTX.COM
DLNOYYVQSOZHH.COM OTPWFJOKPOZOOMNK2O.COM
BFZFLQEJOHXMQ.COM CNEISZDKHZEKQEUBUT.COM
AJFSZWOMNHDFCYY.COM EMUXMJDBTNWCQRFN0G.COM
EXAGQLXTMOPSFT8.COM OWASALWIGURWYVNNPV.COM
FWOGZPAGLGOVLIMY.COM PMNYPARTDBVYHCZDJS.COM

In this task, you are given legitimate domain names and DGA domain names and try to use kMeans to cluster them.
