# Task 9.1P (Pass Task) -  Grid Search with Cross-Validation

## Overview
C and Gamma are the parameters for a nonlinear support vector machine (SVM). The goal of SVM is to find a hyperplane that would leave the widest possible "cushion" between input points from two classes. There is a tradeoff between "narrow cushion, little / no mistakes" and "wide cushion, quite a few mistakes".

Small C makes the cost of misclassificaiton low ("soft margin"), thus allowing more of them for the sake of wider "cushion". Large C makes the cost of misclassification high ('hard margin"), thus forcing the algorithm to explain the input data stricter and potentially overfit.
