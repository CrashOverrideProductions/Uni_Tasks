# Task 8.1P (Pass Task) -  PCA dimensionality reduction

## Overview
PCA (Principle Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique that projects the data into a lower dimensional space. It can be used to reduce high dimensional data into 2 or 3 dimensions so that we can visualize and hopefully understand the data better.
