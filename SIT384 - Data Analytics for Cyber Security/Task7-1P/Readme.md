# Task 7.1P (Pass Task) -  K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering

## Overview
In machine learning, clustering is used for analyzing and grouping data which does not include prelabeled class or even a class attribute at all. K-Means clustering and hierarchical clustering are all unsupervised learning algorithms.

K- means is a collection of objects which are “similar” between them and are “dissimilar” to the objects belonging to other clusters. It is a division of objects into clusters such that each object is in exactly one cluster, not several.

In Hierarchical clustering, clusters have a tree like structure or a parent child relationship. Here, the two most similar clusters are combined together and continue to combine until all objects are in the same cluster.

In this task, you use K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical algorithms to cluster a given dataset and compare their difference.
