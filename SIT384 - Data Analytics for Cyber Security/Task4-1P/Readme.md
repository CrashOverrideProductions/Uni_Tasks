# Task 4.1P (Pass Task) - Visualize data using matplotlib

## Overview
Cyber security attacks can be grouped into 4 categories: DOS attack, PROBE attack, R21 attack, and U2R attack.  

There are 11 different kinds of attacks in DOS, 7 kinds of attacks in PROBE, 15 kinds of attacks in R21, and 8 kinds of attacks in U2R.

The above information can be represented by:  
attack‐labels = ['DOS', 'U2R', 'R21', 'PROBE']
attack_type = [11, 8, 15, 7]

You are asked to visualize the above information using matplotlib with the following settings:  
- [x] figsize=(7,5), dpi=100  
- [x] colors = ['blue', 'red', 'green', 'yellow'] for DOS, U2R, R21 and PROBE, respectively.
- [x] X axis label: Attack category
- [x] Y axis label: Number of attack types
- [x] Title: Attack categories and num of types in Cyber Security
