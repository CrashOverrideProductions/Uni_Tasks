# Task 5.1P (Pass Task) - Pearson's-r coefficient

## Overview
The Pearson’s correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables.

Correlation values range between -1 and 1. There are two key components of a correlation value:
• magnitude – The larger the magnitude (closer to 1 or -1), the stronger the correlation
• sign – If negative, there is an inverse correlation. If positive, there is a regular correlation.

Numpy implements a corrcoef() function that returns a matrix of correlations of x with x, x with y, y with x and y with y. We’re interested in the values of correlation of x with y (so position (1, 0) or (0, 1)). The values of correlation of x with y might be Positive Correlation, Negative Correlation, or No/Weak Correlation.
