# Task 2.1P (Pass Task) - Fibonacci sequence

## Overview
A Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.... The first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two terms. The nth term is the sum of (n‐1)th and (n‐2)th term. Define a function which accepts a passed argument and calculates its Fibonacci sequence. A program accepts user’s input and calls the function. (Please DO NOT use recursive function call in the function definition.)
